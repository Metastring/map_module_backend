# CML APIs - Map Module Backend

A comprehensive backend service that helps researchers and scientists work with biodiversity and geographical data through interactive maps and spatial queries.

## What This System Does

This backend service acts as a bridge between biodiversity databases and map visualization tools. Think of it as a smart assistant that:

1. **Manages Map Data**: Stores and organizes geographical information about plants, animals, and their locations
2. **Creates Interactive Maps**: Converts raw data into visual maps that can be displayed on websites
3. **Answers Spatial Questions**: Helps find answers like "What species exist in this area?" or "Where can I find this particular plant?"
4. **Connects Different Systems**: Links databases, map servers, and web applications together

## Main Components

### üó∫Ô∏è GeoServer Management (geoserver folder)
**What it does**: Manages a map server called GeoServer that creates visual maps from your data.

**Key Features**:
- **Upload Map Data**: Takes your data files (like spreadsheets with location information) and prepares them for mapping
- **Create Workspaces**: Organizes your data into different projects or categories
- **Manage Layers**: Each dataset becomes a "layer" that can be shown or hidden on maps
- **Connect to Databases**: Links to PostgreSQL databases where your biodiversity data is stored
- **Generate Map Tiles**: Creates the actual map images that appear in web browsers

**Real-world example**: If you have a spreadsheet of bird sightings with GPS coordinates, this system can turn that into a visual map showing bird locations as dots or areas.

### üîç Spatial Queries (queries folder)
**What it does**: Provides powerful search capabilities for geographical and biodiversity data using GraphQL technology.

**Key Features**:
- **Area-Based Search**: Draw a shape on a map and find all species within that area
- **Multi-Area Search**: Search across multiple regions at once
- **Species Name Search**: Find all locations where a specific species has been recorded
- **Smart Data Mapping**: Automatically translates between user-friendly names and technical database names

**Real-world example**: A researcher can draw a circle around a forest area and instantly get a list of all plant species recorded in that region, along with their exact locations.

## How the System Works

### Data Flow
1. **Data Storage**: Biodiversity data is stored in PostgreSQL databases
2. **Data Processing**: The system processes location data and species information
3. **Map Creation**: GeoServer converts this data into visual map layers
4. **User Queries**: Users can search and filter data through web interfaces
5. **Results Display**: Search results are returned as both data and visual maps

### Supported Data Types
- **Point Data**: Exact locations (like GBIF species occurrence records)
- **Polygon Data**: Area-based data (like species distribution ranges from Kew Gardens)
- **Scientific Names**: Species identification and matching across datasets

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **FastAPI**: Modern web framework for creating APIs
- **GraphQL**: Flexible query language for complex data requests
- **PostgreSQL**: Database system for storing spatial data
- **GeoServer**: Map server for creating visual map layers
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database connection and query management

### Database Integration
The system connects to PostgreSQL databases containing:
- **GBIF Data**: Global Biodiversity Information Facility records (point locations)
- **Kew Gardens Data**: Royal Botanic Gardens species distribution data (polygon areas)
- **Custom Datasets**: Any additional biodiversity or geographical data

## Key Features for Users
